#h1 Project 2 Recap
Learning HTML was rewarding and fun. I feel like it was an easier style to learn rather than the markup we started with. I liked how on Atom the different elements would be color coded.
In terms of learning CSS, I'm anxious that it won't be as easily picked up for me as well at HTML was. I'm worried about having to rewire my brain in that aspect.
This assignment took me a very long time. I started over a week ago on the project and slowly worked on it. I liked being able to write the code on my own though, it just took a long time.
