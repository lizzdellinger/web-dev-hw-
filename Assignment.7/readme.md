#h1 Dellinger's Assignment 7 Reflection
When choosing fonts, I wanted ones that seemed very whimsical and candy-like. They both are pretty playful, but one of them is curly and cursive while the other is more handwriting-esque and taller and skinnier.
Fall back fonts are important because if the computer someone is reading on doesn't have the font you originally selected, then the fallback font will load up for them to still be able to read it. System fonts are ones already downloaded and useable on your device, web fonts are ones provided through a server, and web safe fonts are families of fonts that are useable on any device anywhere and developers can count on them always being available. 
This assignment was pretty fun, as I love the concept of Typography. It also took a long time for me to complete due to all of the different steps that this week's assignment included.
