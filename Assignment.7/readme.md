#h1 Dellinger's Assignment 7 Reflection
When choosing fonts, I wanted ones that seemed very whimsical and candy-like. They both are pretty playful, but one of them is curly and cursive while the other is more handwriting-esque and taller and skinnier.

This assignment was pretty fun, as I love the concept of Typography. It also took a long time for me to complete due to all of the different steps that this week's assignment included.
