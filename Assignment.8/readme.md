#1 Lizz Dellinger's Assignment 8 Reflection
Padding is the space between the content and the boarder, and margins are the space between the boarders and the edges of the pages.
The hardest part of this assignment for me was working with so many old elements, plus new ones. This class and it's content has proven to be pretty difficult for me, so I'll definitely be practicing over the summer. But having to still connect the hold stuff with the new stuff was the hardest challenge for me.
This assignment took me the longest any of the others have. For some reason I found myself getting distracted very easily and the content of the lesson was hard for me to grasp and understand. It was really fun to be able to write a complete code myself though, or so I tried to do. I felt a little unsure about CSS in general, so I'm not sure how my stylesheets turned out throughout the entire semester.
