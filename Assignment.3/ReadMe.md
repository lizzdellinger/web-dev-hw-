#h1 Technical Report Assignment 3
A page can only have one head page, but can have as many body sections as needed in order to create the desired look and story of the page.
Structural markup is the actual pieces of the sections that are put together to create the page, like the head and body. Semantic markup is the style of the fonts and includes elements like boldness and italics in order to create emphasis.
This was the most enjoyable assignment for me so far! I enjoyed being able to tweak certain elements and be creative but it was also clear enough and never found myself too stumped.
