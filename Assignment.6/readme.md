#h1 Assignment 6 Reflection
So I chose the colors pink, blue, and green in kind of the best "muted neon" that I could because those were the colors I could see in the 90's. I tried to style the page with large color blocks, which were popular in fashion during this era!
Colors: f06ea9, 00bff3, 3cb878
Again, tried to do the best muted neon versions of those three colors, the hexcodes are listed  above.
This assignment was so hard. I'm still not quite sure I got all of the elements, but I tried my best over the entire week. Working on two styles of coding was confusing and hard, and I wasn't sure how to make the style page line up with the HTML page.
