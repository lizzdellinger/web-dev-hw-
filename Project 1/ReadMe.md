<h1> Project 1 </h1>
<p> The main browsers I use for surfing and homework and such are Safari, because I have a Macbook, and Google Chrome, because Safari doesn't support video chatting softwares very well.For this purpose, I'll explain Chrome. Google Chrome uses a user interface, rendering engine, browser engine, and rendering engine to give the web user the visual parts of the page that you see. Chrome also uses, V8, a Javascript Interpreter, in order to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript and have them show what they are supposed to. </p>
<p> On Wayback Machine, I visited MySpace from August 15th, 2000. The funny thing I noticed was the fact that they were advertising that MySpace had "24/7" access over the internet, which is something that's just assumed at this day and age. It has changed to mostly include more advertisements and fun, brightly colored buttons and slideshow graphics. </p>
<p> My work cycle for this assignment went a little bit easier than last time. I was able to navigate all the different softwares and important web pages to complete, so I'm able to get through the lessons and videos in order to quickly get the assignments done a little more clearly. </p>
