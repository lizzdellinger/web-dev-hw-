#Assignment 4 Completion
"Alt Text" stands for Alternative Text Attribute and we use it to describe an image on a web page in more detail so that users with vision impairments can more easily use the site.
Common forms I've seen on the web would be things like "Enter a Username" or "Enter a new password that contains one uppercase letter and a number." These two specifically breed the case and use of security and making sure that my information cannot be accessed by someone who shouldn't be able to access it.
This is the assignment that has taken me the longest by far. It was somewhat easy to understand, I think I'm getting the grasp of things, there was just so much material to go through and take notes on. By the end of it, my hand forgot how to hold a pen.
